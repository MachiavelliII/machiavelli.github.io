### سَلامٌ

I'll share in this write-up how I discovered my first €€€€ bounty.

At first, I started with basic manual recon because the program's scope was just a set of URLs related to different services, such as:

- `https://ex.admin.service.example.com/`
- `https://ex.service.service.example.com/`
- `https://ex.abc.service.example.com/`

The program also provided credentials to test different roles.

I then browsed the sites while proxying the traffic through Burp and testing the functionalities like a normal user. However, there weren’t any interesting features—except for the sorting functionality. I noticed some intriguing parameters that I had already seen in some *JS* files:

`SelectedSources` and `SelectedTemplateNames`.  

At first, I thought they might fetch data from a database (yeah that makes sense :D), so I decided to test them with special characters, searching for anomalies like `{", ', \}`. When I entered a single quote, I got a `500 HTTP status code (Internal Server Error)`. Adding another single quote returned a `200 HTTP status code (OK)`.

```
https://ex.service.example.com/history?selectedSources=someSources' > 500

https://ex.service.example.com/history?selectedSources=someSources'' > 200
```

Sometimes, I use a backslash to confirm my suspicions. In this case, I got a `400 Bad Request` (since it was a Java app running on Apache Tomcat, the backslash needed to be encoded as `%5c`).

```
https://ex.service.example.com/history?selectedSources=someSources\' > 400
```

After that, I tried running `sqlmap` to extract the database version. Unfortunately, `sqlmap` didn’t retrieve anything except that the DBMS was `PostgreSQL`. However, I didn’t give up—I switched to `ghauri` instead:

```
ghauri -u "https://ex.service.example.com/history?selectedSources=someSources" --dbms=postgres --cookie="JSESSIONID=09326D266052B6B0F7E391B7BBD3A284" --dbs
```

**Boom!**

```

Ghauri resumed the following injection point(s) from stored session:

I reported the vulnerability, and within just one hour, the triager forwarded my report to the company. They quickly acknowledged the issue.

The next day, the company awarded me a bounty.

**Final Thoughts:**  
Don’t limit yourself to just one tool, technique, or program you don’t fully understand—it will only burn you out. The internet is already full of vulnerabilities waiting to be discovered.
